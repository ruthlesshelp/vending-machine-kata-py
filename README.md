# Vending Machine Kata

Practicing the Vending Machine Kata in Python

This Kata is by Guy Royse. You can find more info: [Vending Machine Kata](https://github.com/guyroyse/vending-machine-kata)

## Overview

In this exercise, you're asked to create the core functionality of a vending machine. This includes accepting and managing money, providing change, keeping track of inventory, and dispensing items. Essentially, it should perform all the typical operations one would anticipate from a vending machine.

The primary purpose of this kata is to offer a moderately complex challenge that serves as an opportunity to hone Test-Driven Development (TDD) skills. A considerable part of the challenge will involve deciding which tests to write and, crucially, determining the order in which they should be tackled.

**Important explanation:** all the files in this repo are the _result_ of the coding I practiced here.

If you want to practice this Kata, I recommend that you begin with your own folder or repo, such as `my_vending_machine_kata`.

### Setting Up

#### Just need the TL;DR?

Set up in your own working folder with your favorite editor.

The TL;DR steps for `venv` and `pip` should work on macOS (and probably Linux)

They _should_ work on many versions of Python, including Python 3.7+

* What About Windows?
  - The `source venv/bin/activate` line wonâ€™t work for Windows.
  - For cmd.exe, use `venv\Scripts\activate.bat` instead
    ```bash
    C:\> python -m venv venv
    C:\> venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    C:\> pip install pytest
    ```
  - For PowerShell, use `venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` instead:
    ```bash
    PS C:\> python -m venv venv
    PS C:\> venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    PS C:\> pip install pytest
    ```

#### TL;DR Steps

1. Use Python >= 3.11 and a virtual environment:
    ```zsh
    $ python3 --version
    Python 3.11.7

    $ python3 -m venv venv

    $ source venv/bin/activate
    (venv) $ 
    ```

2. Install `pytest` version >= 8
    ```zsh
    (venv) $ pip install pytest

    ... installation info

    (venv) $ pytest --version
    pytest 8.0.2
    ```

3. Running `pytest` like this:
    ```zsh
    (venv) $ pytest getting_started/test_vending_machine.py
    ```

4. Returns
    ```zsh
    ====================== test session starts ======================
    platform darwin -- Python 3.11.7, pytest-8.0.2, pluggy-1.4.0
    rootdir: /Users/ ... /vending-machine-kata-py

    getting_started/test_vending_machine.py .                  [100%]

# Getting Started

Here are the steps that I undertook to get started.

Created the `getting_started` folder.

Under the `getting_started` folder:
1. Create the `test_vending_machine.py` file

2. Write a failing test:
```python
from vending_machine import VendingMachine

def test_getting_started():
    # Arrange
    class_under_test = VendingMachine()

    # Act

    # Assert
    assert type(class_under_test) is VendingMachine
```

3. See the test fail.

I ran `pytest` from the repo root directory and passed the subfolder path and filename. For the iterations, make/change directory to the working folder to limit the `pytest` discovery to that folder.

Running:
```zsh
(venv) $ pytest getting_started/test_vending_machine.py
```

Returns:
```zsh
=================================== test session starts ====================================
platform darwin -- Python 3.11.7, pytest-8.0.2, pluggy-1.4.0
rootdir: /Users/ ... /vending-machine-kata-py

========================================== ERRORS ==========================================
_________________ ERROR collecting getting_started/test_vending_machine.py _________________

Hint: make sure your test modules/packages have valid Python names.

```

4. Create the `VendingMachine` class in the `vending_machine.py` file with just enough code to pass the test.

Running:
```zsh
(venv) $ pytest getting_started/test_vending_machine.py
```

Returns:
```zsh

getting_started/test_vending_machine.py .                                                        [100%]

# Iterations

## Prior Iterations

1. [Return Coins](iter01/README.md)
1. [Accept Coins](iter02/README.md)
1. [Select Product](iter03/README.md)

Below is the iteration I'm currently working on ...

## Iter04: Make Change

Change working directory to `iter04`

_As a vendor_  
_I want customers to receive correct change,_  
_so that they will use the vending machine again_  

When a product is selected that costs less than the amount of money in the machine, then the remaining amount is placed
in the coin return.

## Test 38

Test `coin_return` property
when payment 7 quarters
and chips is pressed
expect coin return has 5 quarters

## Test 39

Test `coin_return` property
when payment 9 dimes
and chips is pressed
expect coin return has 1 quarter, 1 dime, and 1 nickel

## Test 40

Test `coin_return` property
when payment 1 quarter
and chips is pressed
display shows PRICE $0.50
expect coin return is empty

## Test 41

Test `coin_return` property
when payment 3 quarters and 1 dime
and candy is pressed
expect coin return has 2 dimes

## Test 42

_Let's try some relatively large numbers of coins as input and use Excel to get the `expected` return_

**NOTE:** this probably isn't the desired behavior, but we are _checking that the code works as it's intend to work by the developer_.

Test `coin_return` property
and insert 7919 quarters
and insert 7829 dimes
and insert 7723 nickels
and candy is pressed
expect coin return has 12592 quarters, 1 dime, 1 nickel
