# Vending Machine Kata

Practicing the Vending Machine Kata in Python

This Kata is by Guy Royse. You can find more info: [Vending Machine Kata](https://github.com/guyroyse/vending-machine-kata)

## Overview

In this exercise, you're asked to create the core functionality of a vending machine. This includes accepting and managing money, providing change, keeping track of inventory, and dispensing items. Essentially, it should perform all the typical operations one would anticipate from a vending machine.

The primary purpose of this kata is to offer a moderately complex challenge that serves as an opportunity to hone Test-Driven Development (TDD) skills. A considerable part of the challenge will involve deciding which tests to write and, crucially, determining the order in which they should be tackled.

**Important explanation:** all the files in this repo are the _result_ of the coding I practiced here.

If you want to practice this Kata, I recommend that you begin with your own folder or repo, such as `my_vending_machine_kata`.

### Setting Up

#### Just need the TL;DR?

Set up in your own working folder with your favorite editor.

The TL;DR steps for `venv` and `pip` should work on macOS (and probably Linux)

They _should_ work on many versions of Python, including Python 3.7+

* What About Windows?
  - The `source venv/bin/activate` line wonâ€™t work for Windows.
  - For cmd.exe, use `venv\Scripts\activate.bat` instead
    ```bash
    C:\> python -m venv venv
    C:\> venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    C:\> pip install pytest
    ```
  - For PowerShell, use `venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` instead:
    ```bash
    PS C:\> python -m venv venv
    PS C:\> venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    PS C:\> pip install pytest
    ```

#### TL;DR Steps

1. Use Python >= 3.11 and a virtual environment:
    ```zsh
    $ python3 --version
    Python 3.11.7

    $ python3 -m venv venv

    $ source venv/bin/activate
    (venv) $ 
    ```

2. Install `pytest` version >= 8
    ```zsh
    (venv) $ pip install pytest

    ... installation info

    (venv) $ pytest --version
    pytest 8.0.2
    ```

3. Running `pytest` like this:
    ```zsh
    (venv) $ pytest getting_started/test_vending_machine.py
    ```

4. Returns
    ```zsh
    ====================== test session starts ======================
    platform darwin -- Python 3.11.7, pytest-8.0.2, pluggy-1.4.0
    rootdir: /Users/ ... /vending-machine-kata-py

    getting_started/test_vending_machine.py .                  [100%]

# Getting Started

Here are the steps that I undertook to get started.

Created the `getting_started` folder.

Under the `getting_started` folder:
1. Create the `test_vending_machine.py` file

2. Write a failing test:
```python
from vending_machine import VendingMachine

def test_getting_started():
    # Arrange
    class_under_test = VendingMachine()

    # Act

    # Assert
    assert type(class_under_test) is VendingMachine
```

3. See the test fail.

I ran `pytest` from the repo root directory and passed the subfolder path and filename. For the iterations, make/change directory to the working folder to limit the `pytest` discovery to that folder.

Running:
```zsh
(venv) $ pytest getting_started/test_vending_machine.py
```

Returns:
```zsh
=================================== test session starts ====================================
platform darwin -- Python 3.11.7, pytest-8.0.2, pluggy-1.4.0
rootdir: /Users/ ... /vending-machine-kata-py

========================================== ERRORS ==========================================
_________________ ERROR collecting getting_started/test_vending_machine.py _________________

Hint: make sure your test modules/packages have valid Python names.

```

4. Create the `VendingMachine` class in the `vending_machine.py` file with just enough code to pass the test.

Running:
```zsh
(venv) $ pytest getting_started/test_vending_machine.py
```

Returns:
```zsh

getting_started/test_vending_machine.py .                                                        [100%]

# Iterations

## Prior Iterations

1. [Return Coins](iter01/README.md)
1. [Accept Coins](iter02/README.md)
1. [Select Product](iter03/README.md)
1. [Make Change](iter04/README.md)
1. [Sold Out](iter05/README.md)

Below is the iteration I'm currently working on ...

## Iter06: Exact Change Only

Change working directory to `iter06`

_As a customer,_
_I want to be told when exact change is required,_
_so that I can determine if I can buy something with the money I have before inserting it_

When the machine is not able to make change with the money in the machine for any of the items that it sells, it will display EXACT CHANGE ONLY instead of INSERT COIN.

### Test 48

Test display
when unable to make change
expect display shows exact change only

### Test 49

_How do you determine if exact change required?_

| Product |  Cola | Chips | Candy |
|:--------|------:|------:|------:|
| Price   | $1.00 | $0.50 | $0.65 |

**Valid coins:** nickels ($0.05), dimes ($0.10), and quarters ($0.25)

- **Cola:**
  - Change cannot be made if there are no nickels for change
  - Example: 3 quarters ($0.75) + 3 dimes ($0.10) = $1.05
  - Otherwise, change is can be made by returning excess coins

- **Chips:**
  - Change cannot be made if there are no nickels for change.
  - Example: 1 quarter ($0.25) + 3 dimes ($0.10) = $0.55

- **Candy:**
  - Change cannot be made if there are no dimes or no nickels for change.
  - Example 1: 7 dimes = $0.70
  - Example 2: 3 quarters = $0.75

So, if there are no nickels or dimes for change, then the machine cannot make change.

Test display
when no nickels to make change
expect display shows exact change only
